## ðŸ“œ About the Game

Vellum is a slow-paced, atmospheric text adventure built entirely in Python.  
You explore an abandoned estate steeped in 19th-century gothic mood, solving puzzles and piecing together fragments of Dr. Vellumâ€™s obsession with immortality and control.

The game is designed for **immersion and discovery**:
- No flashing hints
- No tutorial hand-holding
- Atmosphere and subtle cues guide your decisions

Born from late-night brainstorming sessions with Chad (my trusty AI co-dev), Vellum is where the Terminal Minds journey began.
