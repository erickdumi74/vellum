# 🕯️ Vellum

**An atmospheric, text-based adventure about obsession and consequences.**  

Unravel the secrets of Dr. Alaric Vellum’s final experiment.
Vellum is a slow-paced, atmospheric text adventure built entirely in Python.  

You explore an abandoned estate steeped in 19th-century gothic mood, solving puzzles and piecing together fragments of Dr. Vellum’s obsession with immortality and control.

The game is designed for **immersion and discovery**:
- No flashing hints
- No tutorial hand-holding
- Atmosphere and subtle cues guide your decisions

Born from late-night brainstorming sessions with Chad (my trusty AI co-dev), Vellum is where the Terminal Minds journey began.

## 📜 Lore Snapshot
Dr. Alaric Vellum chased a geometry of power he could almost name. The manor remembers. The mirrors remember more.

Decades ago, strange lights and symbols flickered through the manor of **Dr. Alaric Vellum**—and then, silence. You arrive to dust and echoes: a Study, a dim Hallway, a sealed Lab, and chambers that remember more than they reveal. Find the truth of Vellum’s last experiment, decide your role in it, and—if you can—leave before something else decides for you.
